Partner
=======

I'm looking for a co-founder/partner for a software test automation startup. Someone who can help transform my freelance consulting company into a scalable business.

https://one-shore.com

I'm a well-connected expert in the field of software testing, but I need someone to handle the customer facing aspect of the business -- sales, marketing, support, etc. -- and help build our internal team.

Location:
---------

100% Remote. I'm in Libby, Montana, which is pretty remote.

I'm a big fan of distributed teams. If you're near a technology hub like the Bay Area or Austin TX, or can travel, that would be great, not not necessary.

Qualifications:
---------------

You should have experience in the software industry. Enterprise sales, product management, customer support leadership, etc. Ideally you should also have previous startup experience.

NO COVID MASK, SHOT, OR STATUS IS REQUESTED OR REQUIRED.

Responsibilities:
-----------------

Build a sales process from the ground up. Develop marketing strategy and generate business related content. Take care of customer needs and issues. Grow internal team to meet these goals.

Start date:
-----------

I'm ready when you are. But I'm dedicated to finding the right partner, so I'll keep looking until I do.

Pay:
----

Initial salary will be low, but negotiable. Up to 25% equity for the right person and generous sales commissions -- up to 50% net. Finding is important, but managing & renewing accounts is also rewarded.

Contact
-------

Feel free to contact me if interested.

No outside funding, but open to the right partner/investor.

I'm also looking for interested people with technical skills -- development, testing, operations, etc. but I don't have the capital or structure to hire for those positions yet.
