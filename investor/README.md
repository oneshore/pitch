One Shore Executive Summary
===========================

Overview:
=========
Test Automation Services
------------------------

- Freelance test consultantancy - Aaron Evans
- 20 year veteran industy expert
- 10x the work I can possibly handle
- I need a business partner who can help grow company
- Capital to expand team rapidly
- And meet industry demand

Problem:
========
Software Testing is Hard
------------------------

- Speed of delivery is a differentiator
- But so is quality -- bad reviews or security breaches can be devastating
- Agile, DevOps, Continiuous Delivery, Digital Transformation
- initiatives often fail
- Testing is the bottleneck
- But testing receives little love
- And knowledge of best practices is rare
- Usually relegated to junior employees, or substandard developers
- Need to combine different level of testing:
	unit, integration, functional, system, performance
- Actionable reporting from tests is almost non-existent
- Historical trends are even rarer

Solution:
=========
Services + Integration + Dashboard
----------------------------------

- Companies need someone to advise them on how testing fits in their process
- Train employees in testing best practices
- Help them build frameworks
- Teach a man to fish...
- Shovel sellers, not gold miners...
- We combine the best tools and practices with a templated process
- Save organizations the time of building themselves
- Provide them a way to get all their information from different test sources in one place
- Enabling them to make delivery decisions lightning fast

Target Market
=============
Rapidly Growing Startups & Large Enterprises
--------------------------------------------

- Worked with small development shops, rapidly growing startups, and large enterprises
- Small shops are ok for an individual consultant
- We want startups going from 100->1000 employees
- Or large organizations with a digital transformation initiative
- Cost of a single employee / contractor to get started
- And freemium report to advertise services

Competitive Advantages:
=======================
Expertise & Single Source of Truth
----------------------------------

- Leading expert in software testing field
- Solution would incorporate all levels of testing
- Nobody is doing this
- Testing vendors are focusing on SaaS model
- Not taking advantage of high value added services
- Not able to incorporate "competing" vendors which may be complementary
- Consulting companies are body shops with no-stickiness
- Dashboard and historical data analysis will give customer insights

- Potential partner channels

Costs:
======
Acquiring Customers + Scaling
-----------------------------

- I'm a one man shop
- If I could clone myself, I'd have multiple job offers every month
- That's at least 150K * 12
- But I don't have expertise -- or time -- to do sales
- Or to organize & manage a team
- I do have expertise to train and scale teams with previous jobs and clients

Projections:
============
$1M revenue in first year
-------------------------

- Instead of doing it manually for each client

Ask:
====
- $100K for 10% for 6 months
- First option for 10% more after 1 year growth
- Payback if not interested in continuing
